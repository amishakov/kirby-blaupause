# Kirby Blaupause – A Template for Kirby CMS

This template is a starter for new projects, mainly developed out of personal needs. It's based on the tools and technologies we work with and might serve as an inspiration to others.

## Frontend setup
The frontend uses [pnpm](https://pnpm.io), is built using [Vite]([https://vitejs.](https://vitejs.dev/)) with [lightingcss](https://lightningcss.dev/) as css transformer and minifier. [cleacss](https://cleacss.dev) is preinstalled as css framework. Scripts are handled by Typescript, [svelte](https://svelte.dev) and [taxi](https://taxi.js.org) are preconfigured if needed.

## Preinstalled plugins
- distantnative/retour-for-kirby
- femundfilou/kirby-asset-manager
- femundfilou/kirby-image-snippet
- getkirby/cli
- getkirby/staticache
- lukaskleinschmidt/kirby-laravel-vite
- tobimori/kirby-seo
- genxbe/kirby3-ray
- johannschopplich/kirby-plausible
- bnomei/kirby3-dotenv
- timnarr/kirby-obfuscate-email
- junohamburg/kirby-visual-block-selector


## Prebuild blocks
This template comes with some prebuild blocks and block extensions.
- Since we don't use the built-in layouts feature but rely on layout-blocks (see [fullwidth.yml](./backend/site/blueprints/layouts/fullwidth.yml))
- simple `button` block
- `spacer` block to add clearances
- `video` block that supports local videos
- `jumpmark` as a target for buttons and links

## Custom folder setup
This template uses a custom folder setup. The kirby installation is divided by two individual folders `public` and `backend` to keep kirby's internal files out of the domain root. Since we're often using pipelines to deploy website updates, the `storage` folder keeps all static things available, like `content`, `accounts`, `sessions`, `logs` and `license`, that don't always change on a website update.

The `frontend` is the last folder remaining and it's the home of all frontend source files. We're using Vite to build assets and a `manifest.json` to `public/build`, where they're consumed by kirby.

## Getting started
- Run `nvm use` to switch to the correct node version
- Run `pnpm install` to install frontend dependencies
- Run `pnpm build` to make an initial assets build
- Run `composer install` to install backend dependencies
- Optional: You can run `kirby init` to get rid of some of the boilerplate code and naming conventions. The script will guide you through the steps. You have to install the [Kirby CLI](https://github.com/getkirby/cli) (globally) to use that command.
